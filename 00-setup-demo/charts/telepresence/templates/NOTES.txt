Congratulations!


You have successfully installed the Traffic Manager component of Telepresence!
Now your users will be able to `telepresence connect` to this Cluster and create
intercepts for their services!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next Steps
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Take a look at our RBAC documentation for setting up the minimal required RBAC
roles for your users at
https://www.getambassador.io/docs/telepresence/latest/reference/rbac/

- Ensure that you are keeping up to date with Telepresence releases 
https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/releases so that your Traffic
Manager is the same version as the telepresence client your users are running!
